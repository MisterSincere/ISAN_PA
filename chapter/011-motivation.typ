== Motivation
Emergency response scenarios are characterized by extreme time pressure, high cognitive load, and the need for rapid, well-informed decision-making.
In such contexts, the timely availability of accurate information is critical.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that a significant number of fatalities in emergency and disaster situations could be prevented if first responders had faster access to relevant and reliable information (World Health Organization, 2019).
These findings emphasize that effective emergency response depends not only on operational capabilities but also on how information is provided to human operators.

At the same time, substantial progress has been made in the digitalization of emergency response infrastructures.
Modern fire departments and emergency services operate a wide range of specialized systems, including alerting, dispatch, and reporting platforms.
A standard like the International Standard Accident Number (ISAN) allows incidents to be uniquely identified and to correlate data from different systems / data silos.
From a technical standpoint, the infrastructure required to exchange life-saving data across heterogeneous systems is largely available.
However, the existence of such systems alone does not ensure that information can be accessed and interpreted efficiently in real-world emergency situations.

From a human–computer interaction (HCI) perspective, the user interface represents the critical link between complex backend systems and human decision-makers.
Research in HCI has demonstrated that interface design has objective effects on user performance, error rates, and cognitive workload (Norman, 2013; Nielsen, 1994).
In emergency contexts, responders operate under stress and time constraints that limit working memory and increase the risk of errors (Endsley, 1995).
Poorly designed user interfaces can amplify these limitations by presenting information in an unstructured, fragmented, or unintuitive manner, leading to delayed responses or misinterpretation of critical data.

Despite established usability principles and modern web technologies, many emergency management systems continue to suffer from fragmented workflows and insufficient integration of relevant data sources.
Emergency responders are often required to consult multiple systems to obtain a complete picture of an incident, increasing cognitive effort and response time (Blandford et al., 2012).
Such interaction patterns conflict with fundamental HCI principles, including the reduction of cognitive load and the prioritization of critical information.

The motivation for this thesis is to address these challenges by designing and implementing a user-centered curing system interface that consolidates incident-related data from multiple sources into a single web application.
By leveraging standardized identifiers such as ISAN and applying established HCI principles, the system aims to support situational awareness and enable faster, more informed decision-making.
Ultimately, this work seeks to demonstrate how thoughtful interface design can contribute to more effective emergency response and support the overarching goal of saving lives.
