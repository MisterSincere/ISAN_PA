This thesis addresses the challenge of improving information accessibility in emergency response by designing a modular web-based curing system interface for the International Standard Accident Number (ISAN) system.

A component-based architecture with asynchronous module loading and a configurable dashboard layout have been implemented using Vue/TypeScript on the front end and Python/Flask on the back end.
Furthermore integrating new relevant emergency information has been made possible through a modular loading system and configuration scheme. 

The resulting prototype supports dynamic data retrievel, adaptive module presentation, and customizable dashboard arrangements, while meeting highlighted accessibility metrics. 
In conclusion, the system implements a structured, modular UI that supports faster and more reliable access to emergency information with the technical foundation for future extensions within the ISAN-based rescue chain.
